1. What is a networking model in networking?
	- A networking model, sometimes also called either a _networking architecture_ or _networking blueprint_, refers to a comprehensive set of documents.
2. Individually, what each document describe?
	- Each document describes one small function required for a network.
3. collectively, what these document define?
	- Collectively, these documents define everything that should happen for a computer network to work.
4. What is a protocol, defined by some documents?
	- Is a set of logical rules that devices must follow to communicate.
5. Which are the physical requirements defined by others documents?
	- A document could define the voltage and current levels used on a particular cable when transmitting data.
6. What is the networking model used today?
	- TCP/IP.
7. What ISO stand for?
	- International Organization for Standardization
8. What model ISO does created?
	- OSI.
9. What OSI stand for?
	- Open Systems Interconnection.
10. What was the noble goal of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model?
	- To standardize data networking protocols to allow communication among all computers across the entire planet.
11. What DoD stand for?
	- U.S. Departement of Defense
12. What model DoD does created 
	- A model called TCP/IP.
13. What the TCP/IP model defines and references that allow computers to communicate
	- The TCP/IP model both defines and references a large collection of protocols that allow computers to communicate. 
14. By using what, TCP/IP define a protocol?
	- To define a protocol, TCP/IP uses documents called Requests For Comments (RFC).
15. What each layer of the TCP/IP does define to create a working communication system?
	- Each layer broadly defines a set of functions that helps create a working communication system.
16. What RFC gives at each layer of the TCP/IP model?
	- Each RFC gives the specifics about an option to implement one or more of the functions at some layer of the model.
17. How the TCP/IP model does to avoid repeating work already done?
	- The TCP/IP model also avoids repeating work already done by some other standards body or vendor consortium by simply referring to standards or protocols created by those groups. For example, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) defines Ethernet LANs; the TCP/IP model does not define Ethernet in RFCs, but refers to IEEE Ethernet as an option.
18. What IEEE stand for?
	- Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers
19. What NIC stand for?
	- Network Interface Card
20. What does the NIC implements in the Physical layer and Data-Link layer?
	- Implement the standards for both layer to support physical communications.
21.  What the OS in the computer implements?
	- The OS on the computer implements protocols from the network and transport layers.
22. What the web browser does implements?
	- The web browser implements some application layer protocols (for instance, HTTP or HTTPS.)
23. What the Physical layer focuses on?
	- The physical layer focuses on how to transmit bits over each link. 
24. What the Data-Link layer focuses on?
	- The data-link layer focuses on the rules that control the use of the physical link.
25. What the Network layer focuses on?
	- The network layer focuses on delivering data over the entire path from the original sending computer to the final destination computer.
26. What the Transport layer and the Application layer focus on?
	- The top two layers focus more on the applications that need to send and receive data. For instance, how to identify data, how to ask for the data to be sent, and how to recover the data if lost in transmission.
27. What are the common protocols for each layers?
	- Application: HTTPS, POP3, SMTP
	- Transport: TCP, UDP
	- Network: IP, ICMP
	- Physical & Data-Link: Ethernet, 802.11 (Wi-Fi)
28. What the Application layer provides services to?
	- To the software running on a computer.
29. What the Application layer does define?
	- Defines services that applications need. For example, application protocol HTTP defines how web browsers can pull the contents of a web page from a web server. 
30. What HTTP stand for?
	- Hypertext Transfer Protocol.
31. What HTTP is used for?
	- To request files from the server and giving the server a way to return the content of those files.
32. How HTTP works?
